# 📰 Sarcasm Detector of News Headlines

An NLP-based Machine Learning project that classifies news headlines as sarcastic or non-sarcastic.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project builds a sarcasm detection model using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

The dataset contains headlines from:
- The Onion (Sarcastic)
- HuffPost (Non-Sarcastic)

The model predicts:
- 1 → Sarcastic
- 0 → Not Sarcastic

# 📘 Project Overview

## Problem Statement

Sarcasm detection is difficult because sarcastic sentences often use positive words to express negative meaning.

Example:
"I absolutely love being ignored."

The goal is to build a classification model to detect sarcasm in news headlines.

## Objectives

- Clean and preprocess text data
- Convert text into numerical features
- Train classification model
- Evaluate performance
- Store predictions in SQL database
